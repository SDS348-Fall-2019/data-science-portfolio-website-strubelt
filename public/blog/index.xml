      <description>Fall 2019â€¦ Where to even start. The followig semster has been insane. This semester by far was the hardest that I ever had. I was registered for 16 hours, worked 40+ hours a week, but some how I still made it to the end. I walked into this semster worried because of the classes that I was registered for. The two that I was worried the most about pertained to my major but they ended up being the classes that I enjoyed the most.</description>
