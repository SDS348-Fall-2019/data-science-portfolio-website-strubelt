description: 'The Second 2 Last Semester'
---
Fall 2019... Where to even start. The followig semster has been insane. This semester by far was the hardest that I ever had. I was registered for 16 hours, worked 40+ hours a week, but some how I still made it to the end. I walked into this semster worried because of the classes that I was registered for. The two that I was worried the most about pertained to my major but they ended up being the classes that I enjoyed the most. They were Computational and Cellular Biology. Computational Biology took me by surprise and I really did enjoy this class. I learned things that I was highly interested in one being the basics to python.
