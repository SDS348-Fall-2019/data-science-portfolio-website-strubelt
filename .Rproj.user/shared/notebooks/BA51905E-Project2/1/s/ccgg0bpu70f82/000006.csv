"0","#Very Confused on this part. Since my Categorical Variable has 3 categories rather than 2 I did the mean for Black Vs White, Black vs Hispanic, and for Hispanic vs White. The only example of the randomization test I saw was from lecture 14 and there was only two categories. In this case since there is 3 I looked at the means for all 3 added the means together than averaged the means of the means. "
