"0","#Since the response is going to be a Numeric value, I am going to use the Residual Standard Error from fit5 to compare it to my lasso fit which is fit 6. In fit 5 I wanted to see if the Combine score was predicted well by all the other variables. Once performing a Lasso the only varible that came back was position. A 10 fold CV was then performed on the Combined Score only looking at postion. The residual standard error came back as 9.102 which was greater than that Residual standard error from fit 5 which was  4.084e-15. Since the value was higher, it is not a better fit. "
