"0","#The Assumptions for an Anova are Random Sample/Independent Observations, Independent Samples, Normal Distribution of each group, Equal Variance. I think one of the assumptions that would be broken would be the sample size of the Hispanic Race due to the fact that they have a smaller sample size the rest. With that the variance of the samples is most likely going to be affected since the White race has a value which is nearly trippled that"
